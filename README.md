# roverlay
Roverlay is a simple spec overlay which shows you how much cpu and ram usage you have. It's made to work for linux only.

## Note. If you want the window on the top left of the screen you need to change it with kwin window rules if you're using kde plasma. Window should be above others but can also be manually configured by right clicking it on the taskbar
